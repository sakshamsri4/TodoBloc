Overview
This Flutter project uses the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to manage and maintain the state of tasks and todos. It's structured into various Dart files, each handling specific aspects like events, states, and business logic.

Key Components
TaskBloc: Manages the business logic for tasks.

Events Handled:
LoadTasks: Loads tasks from a REST service.
AddTask: Adds a new task.
SearchTasks: Searches tasks based on a query.
ClearSearch: Clears search results.
InitiateSearch: Initiates a search operation.
States Emitted:
TaskInitial, TasksLoadSuccess, TaskAdditionSuccess, TasksSearchSuccess, TasksSearchEmpty.
TodoBloc: Manages the business logic for todos.

Events Handled:
LoadTodos: Loads todos.
TodoStatusChanged: Updates the status of a todo.
ReorderTodo: Reorders the todos.
AddTodo: Adds a new todo.
DeleteTodo: Deletes a todo.
States Emitted:
TodosInitial, TodosLoadInProgress, TodosLoadSuccess, TodoOperationSuccess, TodoOperationFailure, TodosLoadFailure, TodosCountUpdated.
Models:

TodoModel: Represents a todo item with properties like title, completion status, etc.
Services:

RestService: Handles communication with external REST services for fetching tasks and todos.
Task and Todo Events:

Defines various events like AddTask, LoadTasks, AddTodo, DeleteTodo, etc., which trigger different actions in their respective BLoCs.
Task and Todo States:

Represents various states like TaskInitial, TasksLoadSuccess, TodosInitial, TodosLoadInProgress, etc., reflecting different points in the lifecycle of tasks and todos management.
Usage
To use these BLoCs in a Flutter application:

Import the necessary files into your Flutter project.
Initialize the TaskBloc and TodoBloc in your widget tree.
Use BlocBuilder or BlocListener to build UI components based on the current state of tasks and todos.
Dispatch events to the BLoCs to trigger state changes (e.g., add a task, load todos).
Dependencies
flutter_bloc: Provides the BLoC pattern implementation.
bloc_api_integration: Custom package for this project, handling API integrations.
Conclusion
This README provides a high-level overview of the BLoC components used for managing tasks and todos in a Flutter application. The BLoC pattern helps in efficiently managing state and organizing business logic, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
